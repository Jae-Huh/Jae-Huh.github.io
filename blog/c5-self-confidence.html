                <li>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</li>
                <p>
                  Mindfulness and self awareness both are about not being affected by influences from outside. We can learn to acknowledge them and still be not easily swayed by them by focusing non-judgementally on our inner self in the present moment. Since they are basically the same, practising mindfulness can help develop self-awareness, but to make it even better, Body Scanning and Journaling exercises can enhance the development.
                </p>
                <li>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</li>
                <p>
                  I tried Body Scan. Having body parts and sensations to focus on, I found it easier to breathe more naturally in comparison to when I meditate focusing on my breaths. I did it sitting but would love to try lying down as instructed in the book particularly on sleepless nights!
                </p>
                <li> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</li>
                <p>
                  I love the analogy of sky and clouds. It's a great way to deal with my emotions especially when they are negative kinds as I know since they have come, they will soon go. It helps me acknowledge the emotions rather than be affected by them.
                </p>
