      <h2>Time and Habits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
        <p>I tried sensory meditation focusing on breathing and body parts, but unfortunately, I didn't make it a habbit in my daily life as I kept on forgetting to meditate. I didn't know that meditation could be done in the form of movement. In <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-meditation-affects-your-brain">this article</a>, an example of moving meditation was knitting. I crochet as a hobby, and I realised I was meditating all this time without even realising!</p>
        <li>What did you find interesting?</li>
        <p>I have heard a few people claiming the Pomodoro technique works really well. I haven't tried it myself, and I would like to try it through my study at EDA.</p>
        <li>What worked for you?</li>
        <p>I think meditation worked quite well for me. It makes me feel calm and relaxed.</p>
        <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
        <p>I might try making meditation a habit using an app. I would also like to develop growth mindset by starying small and through small acheivements.</p>
