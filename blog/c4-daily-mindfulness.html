              <ul class="blog-content">
                <li>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</li>
                <p>
                  Usually when I talk to people, I try to listen attentively but the thought of asking questions or commenting arises. Often, instead of giving my full attention, I find my mind wandering thinking about what would be a good question to ask in order to show them I care about what they say.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After reading the chapter, I am trying to give the speakers full attention without interrupting them. When questions come in my mind, I try to acknowledge but quiet them. By not interrupting the talking with comments, I'm noticing the speaker is more enthusiastic and takes their time to think when they run out of things to say.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also noticed that I've been practising looping when listening to others. A good example would be when I ask coding questions to my friend. I listen to the explanation, and then try to rephrase what he said so I can make sure I have understood, and if I have misconceptions, he corrects me. I think I need to extend this practice to not only in knoweldge base conversations but also io experiential or emotional conversations.
                </p>
                <li>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</li>
                <p>
                  I would like to first take one breath a day. It is so easy to do I won't have an excuse if I don't do it. And then, once I am used to it, I'd like to do it multiple times throughout each day slowly transitioning into the technique of doing less than I can.
                </p>
                <li>Any other musings?</li>
                <p>
                  To add more thoughts to the previous question, I find one breath a day technique really interesting. Nowhere I read or heard about pracising meditation suggested it. It's a good starting point for me as I struggle to sustain mindfulness meditation when it comes to practising it. I am not sure it can be actually helpful as it sounds very insignificant but it's definitely a good technique for me to start with to build the habit and be more aware of my intention for meditation.
