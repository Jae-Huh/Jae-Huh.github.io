                <li>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</li>
                <p>
                  Often, I see people driven for what they get in return of what they do for a job, money in most cases, and it's a lie to say I've not thought this way. This chaper has been a good reminder of what's really important to make ourselves happy and made me think about what higher purpose I could have once I become a kickass programmer. I absolutely love flow, and being in flow while programming was the main reason I chose to step into a new career of web development. So.. I would like to believe I'm at least half way there to be happy in the ideal way through pleasure, passion and higher purpose :P
                </p>
                <li>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values? What do you stand for?</li>
                <p>
                  My core values:
                </p>
                <ul class="inner-blog-list">
                  <li>Kindness</li>
                  <li>Humility</li>
                  <li>Effort</li>
                  <li>Empathy</li>
                  <li>Loyalty</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  I stand for love, peace, nature, truth and most importantly, happiness!
                </p>
                <li>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</li>
                <p>
                  I really like the analogy of ocean on happiness, calmness and resilience, and it's how I'd like to think when a whirl of negative emotion or failure hit my ocean, telling myself deep inside the ocean is still a quiet place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I found it interesting how negative feelings and experiences were taking part in the meditation exercise. I always thought positive psychology and optimism was putting focus only on the positives. But I think meditation helps reinforce optimistic way of thinking through bringing the physiological feelings associated with negative and positive experiences, being aware of how they feel and knowing these feelings will pass.
