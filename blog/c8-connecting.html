              <ul class="blog-content">
                <li>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</li>
                <p>
                  When I meet new people, I always tell myself to start off liking them until there is a reason not to. Because of this, I tend to be less defensive of myself and share personal stories with them more which I believe encourages others to talk about themselves as well.
                </p>
                <li>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</li>
                <p>
                  I haven't got a chance to try empathic listening yet, but I like the idea of doing the loving kindness meditation in preparation for empathic listening. I'd have positive thoughts about the other person even before starting to talk with them, and that would be a good cornerstone for the listening practice.
                </p>
                <li>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</li>
                <p>
                  The loving kindness meditation left me with good vibes and it was a nice reminder of what makes the person the way that person is. Next time if there is a person that I find unpleasant, I'd like to try loving kindness meditation with that person's image to see whether it can help me understand his or her behaviour and how it affects my feelings towards the person afterwards.

                <p>
                  I used to work for a small education business that wasn't as successful as it could be. After studying the differences between us and other franchisees overseas, I figured one of the main reasons was unprofessional marketing strategies that my boss pushed anytime he got inspired. Once I've done my research and with full support from our manager from the headquarters, I carefully suggested we start facebook advertisement. The idea was shot down the moment I talked about it for reasons I couldn't comprehend which included phrases like "Nobody uses facebook" and "Parents don't care about the internet". I felt like I've lost all respect for my boss after hearing such comments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My boss' view was based on his personal experiences and learnings. He wasn't really computer literate, and he saw and heard of circulars for a successful competitior which seemed to work really well. From his view, I haven't lived in NZ as long as he did, and I also didn't have enough career experience to talk to him about the areas that he thought he knew much better. He explained that strategies that work overseas might not always work as circumstances could be different.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even after discussing the issue a number of times, we couldn't come to an agreement but I began to see where he was coming from.
