      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
        <p>EDA to me feels like it's always open and welcoming. One of the reasons why I decided to join the community :)</p>
        <li>What are your impressions?</li>
        <p>I really like the friendly atmosphere. I read about the Three Pillars, and love that everyone is encouraged to help each other become not just a great developer, but also a better person.</p>
        <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
        <p>I am quiet but I like people so I'm hoping I can help people in my cohort go through the course together. Also,in my previous job, I worked part-time so I'll have to push myself to work longer hours and make sure I am focused. One of the good things about coding is that time passes so fast!</p>
        <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
        <p>It's only been two days since I started Phase 0, so there's not much that I feel has changed but let's see how it changes as we go deeper into the course!</p>
        <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
        <p>I am very excited to keep studying at EDA. It does make me nervous as I worry that I might not be able to keep up with everyone. I guess hardwork is the solution for that :D</p>
