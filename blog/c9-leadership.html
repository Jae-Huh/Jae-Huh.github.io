              <ul class="blog-content">
                <li>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</li>
                <p>
                  After graduating from university and while job searching, I took a casual role at a company. Although I needed a permanent full time role to apply for a visa, I was desperate to get this job in order to financially support myself. I told my manager this situation I was in at the job interview. I started the job, and soon after, I was given full time equivalent hours of work, but a few months later, my visa expired and I couldn't work until my new visa application was accepted. Knowing my difficult situation and eagerness to live in NZ, my manager kindly waited until I had a new visa. She was also very supportive in finding ways to help me with my residency, which didn't work out in the end, but it made me think about what kind of a leader I would like to be.
                </p>
                <li>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</li>
                <p>
                  I felt uplifted with a better mood. The meditation reminded me to think that everyone has a good side to them and to see them with a positive mind.  I would like to continue this meditation for its effect on the way I think and perceive others' goodness, and to transfer the positive energy I possess by training myself to have the right mindset for it.
                </p>
                <li>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</li>
                <p>
                  As warned by the author, it wasn't an easy process unlike loving kindness or multiplying goodness meditation because I had to confront my fears and worries. However, I believe this is a great practice to acknowledge sufferings, and thus be less affected by them. Even better, if I could transform them into goodness with acceptance, I would be able to be more honest to myself about my own fears, pay more attention to others', and wire my brain to eventually become a more caring and loving person.

                <li>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</li>
                <p>
                  <ul class="inner-blog-list">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Status</strong> - So far with what I learnt in Phase 0, I know I can build something that I wouldn't have dared to before starting the course. Because Phase 0 was remote, I didn't get to see much of other students' progress. I think it will be easier to compare myself with others in bootcamp as we will be working closely together. I'll have to remind myself to see the improvement in my own learning to avoid threatening my status.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Certainty</strong> - It certainly is one of the greatest factor that invokes worry. I started Phase 0 with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I didn't have to learn something that was completely new. However, I know I'll have to learn fast and a lot in bootcamp, and I worry that I might not be a fast learner and bright enough to deal with the curriculum. For easing my mind, my plan is to work harder, longer and smarter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Autonomy</strong> - The best thing to do when faced with stress is either to find a solution to reduce the stress, or realise that I cannot do anything about it and try to stay positive. I get told that I'm very calm and optimistic but that requires a lot of talking in my mind to convince myself. I can see this skill being useful throughout bootcamp and job searching after graduating from EDA.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Relatedness</strong> - I think EDA does a great job at putting their students into thinking of each other as friends and collaborators rather than enemy or competitors through meditation and education on empathy. I believe relating to others is one of core values for success in both life and career.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Fairness</strong> - It doesn't only apply to EDA course, but it's also an important trait one can have both as a leader and a player. Treating everyone equally and being honest will return peace of mind.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <li>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</li>
                <p>
                  I didn't think I had any issues for a diffcult conversation, and so I didn't feel like I doing it just for the sake of writing this blog post. However, I have bookmarked it so I can go back to it when I need to. I think it will help me think about the problem more from a third person's perspective and be less emotional.
