Read or watch chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:
What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
- Several years ago, I spent some time watching lectures on positive psychology by Tal Ben-Shahar and tried mindfulness meditation as explained in those lectures. Back then, I thought of meditation to be where I focus on my breathing while I observe my thoughts when they wander knowing they will only pass like clouds in the sky.


What new things have you learnt about meditation?
- I learnt that setting intention for meditation could be so important. I didn't have an intention when I meditated. But even just creating an intention itself is a form of meditation and it can guide your actions and behaviour towards achieving it. How amazing is that?


Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
- I would first like to find a posture where I am sitting comfortably but alert, and focus on breathing. It has been a while since I last meditated so I would like to get used to it again, and once that's settled with me, I would like to pick an intention for meditating.


Any other musings?
- To be honest, I am quite skeptical about mindfulness' ability to improve physical conditions, even with the examples provided in the chapter, but I fully agree that it improves an ability to focus, and for me to be more relaxed and happy. So I'm definitely going to keep on meditating and if there *is* a physical benefit, I don't have any complaints :)
