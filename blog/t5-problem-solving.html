              <hr />
              <ul class="blog-content">
                <li>Tell your non-tech friend about a time you got blocked on a simple problem and solved it in an elegant way.</li>
                <p>
                  I felt blocked while doing "event-driven DOM modification" exercise. I have followed the instruction correctly but when I tested the code, the counters sometimes weren't adding up correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To figure out what's causing this issue, I started talking about the problem to my friend who was working next to me. I started by explaining to him what the exercise was about and how it's supposed to work while walking him through my code. Then I had an "Aha!" moment as I noticed that the divs were adding classes whenever new events were triggered without removing previously added classes, and as a result, this was confusing the counters. I changed my code, tested, and could see that the numbers were adding up correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I realised that this way of solving problem was what they call "rubber ducky method" except, luckily in my case, I didn't have to talk to an inanimate object :P It was a great way to review my code and to try and understand in depth what happens every line of the code.
                </p>
                <li>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process.</li>
                <p>
                  <ul class="inner-blog-list">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - I haven't personally used pseudocoding but I am aware it is a good way to plan out before the actual code gets written. I am planning to use this process for complex problems I'll be facing soon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Trying something</strong> - When I have a problem to solve and I have a rough idea about what might work, this is my "go to" method. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If it doesn't, I try something else, and if still doesn't work, I approach the problem with different techniques.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - This is a good strategy that helps me go over my code to detect the part that's not working properly. Usually, I notice where things are going wrong in the middle of the process since I take time to really try to read what each line of code is doing. I find it more helpful if I talk to a person rather than a rubber ducky as I tend to skip the explanation for what seems too basic to be the cause of the problem when the audience is not alive!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - When I run my code and it's not working as it's supposed to be, reading error messages is the first thing I do. It gives me an indication of where the error might be, and I can start working on resolving the issue by looking at the indicated line of code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Console.logging</strong> - I try to console.log a lot when I write my code and when I try to fix a problem. As much as I want to maximise the benefit of using console.log, I'm planning to use the debugger where it's appropriate as it can save a lot of time. Although, console.log is still very useful for when I'm writing up my code to make sure there is no error before the whole code gets complicated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Googling</strong> - Most of the time, I can find answers to my questions by Googling. It's the fastest solution I can get before I can ask friends, peers or teachers for help. By googling, I sometimes learn unexpected things as an extra but need to be careful I don't get sidetracked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - Slack channel is a great medium for asking questions to people in my cohort. I haven't asked any coding related questions yet but I know they're there to support each other. I also look forward for discussions we'll be able to have in person once the bootcamp starts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - I haven't reached out for help to the teachers as I was able to resolve the issues using the above strategies. Just like having peers, knowing there is support from teachers makes me feel comfortable even when I face a challenge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - I find the weekly reflection and accountability group posts helpful as they allow me to look back at what I did well and what I need to improve, and to be more objective for reflecting on myself.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <li>Explain to your non-tech friend what <code>.map()</code>, <code>.filter()</code> and <code>.reduce()</code> functions do.</li>
                <p>
                  <ul class="inner-blog-list">
                    <li>
                      <code>.map()</code> - Returns a new array (a list of items) that contains new values after a function modifies every element in the original array.
<pre><code>var names = ["jae", "rowan", "michael", "chelsea"];

<em class="code-comment">// replaces the first character of the names with upper case</em>
names.map(function(val) {
  return val.replace(val[0], val[0].toUpperCase);
})

<em class="code-comment">// returns ["Jae", "Rowan", "Michael", "Chelsea"]</em></code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>.filter()</code> - Creates a new array with the elements that satisfy the condition that is given in a function.
<pre><code>var numbers = [23954, 1238, 6349, 3345, 680, 197, 7533];

<em class="code-comment">// filters through the numbers to find odd numbers and keep only those numbers in the new array</em>
numbers.filter(function(num){
  return num % 2 !== 0;
})

<em class="code-comment">//returns [6349, 3345, 197, 7533]</em></code></pre>

                    <li>
                      <code>.reduce()</code> - Iterates through elements in an array in order, and returns only one value that's been reduced using a provided function.
<pre><code>var numDays = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];

<em class="code-comment">// numDays contains how many days there are in each month. To find out how many days there are in a year, we can use .reduce() to find the sum</em>
numDays.reduce(function(a, b){
  return a + b;
})

<em class="code-comment">//returns 365</em></code></pre>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
